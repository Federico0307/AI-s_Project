## Project goal

In the automotive market, accurately determining the future value of a vehicle is a complex challenge, influenced by a myriad of factors such as make, model, age, mileage, condition and market trends. Buyers and sellers often rely on subjective evaluations resulting in inconsistencies and potential disappointment in deals.

The proposed project aims to test the accuracy of a predictive model capable of estimating the future market price of a car based on a series of characteristics and technical specifications. This project could have practical applications in providing accurate and reliable predictions to support both buyers and sellers in the process of evaluating the value of cars.
